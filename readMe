    This is a collection of all of my C++ programs used to learn the language through https://codewithmosh.com/ ,
labeled Ex, as well as some challenges of my own, labeled Pr.
posted in order and with /* course name date work*/ titles.
    I am mainly posting this for myself for future review and insight. It may also work as a view point for future
work interests to view my growth, expertise, experience, and knowledge.

Thank you for reading!
